## AI as Practice Students

Another intriguing article from Stanford HAI  discusses how AI language models can serve as practice students for new teachers. By  simulating  interactions with students, these  AI models  provide teachers with an opportunity to practice their teaching skills in a safe and controlled  environment. This innovative approach not only  enhances  teaching effectiveness but also improves student engagement  and  learning outcomes. The AI  models can adapt  to different learning styles and provide personalized feedback, creating a more  engaging and interactive learning experience. [^2^]

## Personalized Tutoring Aids

Advancements in AI  have paved the way for personalized tutoring aids and systems that  cater to individual students' needs. A research  review titled "Proactive and Reactive Engagement of Artificial Intelligence Methods for Education: A Review" sheds light on the latest developments in this area.  The review highlights how AI-powered tutoring systems can proactively engage  students by adapting to their learning  preferences and providing real-time feedback. These systems can identify areas where students  struggle and offer targeted interventions, thereby enhancing student engagement and  improving learning outcomes. [^3^]

## Contributing to  Academic Performance

Intelligent tutoring  systems are  not only focused on  enhancing student engagement but also on improving academic performance. An article titled "The Potential of Learning with (and  not from) Artificial Intelligence in Education" explores how AI-powered technologies are being developed to  contribute to students' academic success. These technologies leverage machine learning  algorithms to analyze student performance  data and provide personalized recommendations for improvement.  By identifying areas of weakness and  tailoring  instruction accordingly these systems help  students to achieve better academic outcomes while keeping them engaged throughout the  learning process.
